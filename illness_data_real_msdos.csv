"Shingles (varicella- zoster virus)
Second outbreak of the chicken pox virus.","Localized manifestation of vesicle with red base on skin areas. They follow a nerve tract most often on the chest wall and are usually unilateral and linear.
Severe pain and paresthesia (tingling, prickling sensation) are common.
Rash or blisters present 1-14 days.",,Shingles itself is not contagious but contact with someone with shingles could lead to chicken pox in someone who never had it,,"After chickenpox, the virus is dormant in nerve tissue; as we age, the virus may reappear as shingles when the dormant virus becomes active.

Repeated exposure is generally necessary to become infected so prolonged exposure increases risk.",,"Universal precautions. Mask pt and self. The TB organism dies when exposed to light and air. Skin test annually.  If the TB skin test is positive, will still need to be evaluated to determine if the TB is active.
Incidence of TB rose in 1985, started to decline in 1992 to date probably due to improved control programs. TB can be cured with meds."

suspected based on clinical symptoms and history and confirmed with a laboratory test measuring the antibodies that are produced early.",The disease is spread by a bite of an infected mosquito or blood transfusion of contaminated blood. The virus is in the blood a very short time; people develop an antibody for further protection. The disease is not?ˇtransmitted from person to person.,,"Avoid activities that expose you to mosquito bites; use insect repellant sparingly and one that contains DEET. Use netting over infant carriers.  Try to avoid the outdoors at dawn, dusk
and early evening.  There is no specific treatment, but supportive care for symptoms.  Infections do not last very long."
"Avian or Bird Flu
